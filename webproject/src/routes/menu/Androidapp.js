          <h2>Android App Development</h2>
          <p>The official language for Android development is Java. Large parts of Android are written in Java and its APIs are designed to be called primarily from Java. It is possible to develop C and C++ app using the Android Native Development Kit (NDK), however it isn't something that Google promotes.</p>
          <p>Android software development is the process by which new applications are created for devices running the Android operating system. Google states that[3] "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also possible. All non-JVM languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some languages/programming tools allow cross-platform app support.</p>

          <p>Android apps are built as a combination of components that can be invoked individually. For example, an activity is a type of app component that provides a user interface. The "main" activity is what starts when the user taps your app icon, but you can take the user straight into a different activity from other places, such as from a notification or even from a different app. Other components such as broadcast receivers and services also allow your app to perform background tasks without a user interface.</p>
